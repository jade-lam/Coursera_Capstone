Introduction
The food delivery business segment, is a ~USD 2500m dollar business in Canada in 2020. This is a sector with an expected CAGR of 8.6%. While there is a steady growth trend for online food delivery services, bulk of the revenue is still driven by deliveries from restaurant to consumer. In terms of customer profile, 2019 data suggests that close to 50% of users are below the age of 34 years old and bulk of their income is between low/ medium income. Given the existing penetration rate is just ~25% for restaurants to consumer delivery, and below 20% for platform to consumer delivery. This illustrates there is still huge potential and appetite for delivery businesses to be setup in Canada. (Data source: https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/108/online-food-delivery/canada)

The Business Problem
Identify a city in Canada, which has the best potential for establishing a food delivery business. Based on the city selected, identify possible food delivery service points within the city limits for this business setup. 

The Data
To understand the possible city and service points for this delivery business, a list of data will be obtained and analyzed to generate the results:

1)	Canada’s population data – which will be used to identify the biggest urban cities in Canada, and to understand which city will give the business the best access 
2)	Canada’s commercial restaurant establishment data – which will be used in conjunction with the Canada’s population data and short list a city to setup the delivery business
3)	Canada’s provincial census data – to understand the population density and income profiles within the city limit
4)	Foursquare API data – Foursquare API data will be used to understand the locations of restaurants inside the city chosen. This data will be used in conjunction with the city population profile to identify possible setup points
